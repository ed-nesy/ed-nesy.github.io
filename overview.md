We are currently experiencing a new era of AI where symbolic and neural techniques are being combinedâ€”referred to as Neural-Symbolic AI. This rapidly evolving area combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic approaches, creating AI models, systems, and applications that benefit from both deep learning and symbolic reasoning. 

This workshop provides a venue for researchers, practitioners, and students to present and discuss recent advances, practical applications, and theories in Neural-Symbolic AI. We aim to foster collaboration, spark innovation, and drive progress in developing hybrid AI methodologies capable of solving complex, real-world problems.
